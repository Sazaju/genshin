# Context

We focus here on the Java library for Java developers.

# Objectives

We aim to provide:
- relevant classes and methods to compute useful stuff
- Genshin Impact data to consume with these methods

Data can be official (e.g. characters, weapons, etc.) or not (e.g. theory craft).

# Focus

The focus of the library is on providing an easy to use library for Java developers.
A strong emphasis is given to code quality (easy to use interfaces, well thought designs) and useful computation (meaningful tests).
Optimisations are appreciated but, unless the computation time becomes prohibitive, clear design and ease to maintain the code comes first.

# Technologies

We program in Java.
Testing is done through jUnit 5 for unit tests.
Using libraries goes against the idea of practicing, so we keep it to the bare minimum.
